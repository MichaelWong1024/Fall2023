While completing this assignment:

1. Graph Representation: Using 1D arrays for graphs, as opposed to the conventional 2D adjacency matrices, was initially challenging to grasp.

2. Graph Traversal: The 1D structure added complexity when computing vertex degrees and detecting paths, requiring meticulous indexing.

3. Loop Complexity: Deeply nested loops in path detection necessitated iterative refinements for accuracy and efficiency.
