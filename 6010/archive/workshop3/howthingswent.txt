Throughout the course of this assignment, we began by understanding the core requirements and breaking down the main function to comprehend its underlying logic. This enabled us to streamline the task, omitting redundant conditional compilation lines for clarity. We subsequently dived deep into the 'CalcShortestPaths' function, examining its details line-by-line. With the algorithm thoroughly explained, the code was refactored for better readability and less redundancy. Tools and shortcuts for code formatting in VS Code and Emacs were discussed, enhancing the development experience. Finally, successful compilation instructions were provided. Overall, the process was systematic, collaborative, and focused on both understanding and refining the code.
